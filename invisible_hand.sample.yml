# Region can be one of four values: us, uk, de or ca. Which one you choose will
# determine which API endpoint you will be hitting, which will in turn determine
# what data the API returns. The value you specify here is a default value that
# can be overridden if you want to query multiple regions.
:region:  "us"

# The options in this YAML file will all be sent as default values to the
